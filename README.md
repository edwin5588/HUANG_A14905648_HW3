homework 3 for dsc106......

A big limitation of my turnin is the fact that I am not very experienced with HTML and CSS and JS in general. I had to spend a lot of time to look for resources online and a lot of highchart examples, and it took hours for me to find the right resource to use since a lot of resources used JQuery. Not only that, it took me a day to figure out why the data wasn't loading, and I found out it was because I had to load a server first. I also had to learn a lot of the syntax since it was pretty new for me. To me, the data inputing part was the hardest since all the different kinds of data had different time intervals. I figured out the json file using Jupyter Notebook. It was really easy to display the charts since HighCharts could take in the datetime type and it was a lot easier to make the tick marks. I feel like we should have gotten tiny bits and pieces of this assignment over the course as practice problems, then it builds up to this big assignment because this assignment feels like a project.
